This is a playground as I learn how to develop websites properly. I learnt how to build websites when I was 15, at the time everything was about HTML and CSS and you used Javascript to do some neat tricks ( as in avoid! ) and PHP helped you make the website dynamic. I didnt delve deep into it but now I am back looking into it again and was shocked about how much it has changed!
